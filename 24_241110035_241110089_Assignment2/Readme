Install the required packages (in virtual env):

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv`
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install plotly ipywidgets numpy vtk jupyter
```

Alternatively we have added requirments.txt containing all python packages of our virtual env.
You can also do the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

Code is running fine in both vscode and Jupyter Labs.

Demo video of both present in the folder as Demo-1 and Demo-2.

Jupyter Labs issue: One of the plot or both disappers on first run.
This issue typically occurs due to timing/initialization differences between Jupyter Lab's widget rendering and Plotly's Figure display.We can just move the slider and everything will work fine as expected.
